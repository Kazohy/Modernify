<h1>&nbsp;UI overhaul</h1>

Have you ever looked at minecraft's UI and thought "Hmmmm... this UI looks a bit... outdated"? Well, think no more! This mod is based on [Juxtopposed](https://www.youtube.com/@juxtopposed)'s Minecraft UI revamp, which not only makes it a lot more stylish but also adds a lot of little, but not not useless features.

The mod stays as true as cna be to Juxtopposed'UI, implementing new small (but not useless) quality of life features.
